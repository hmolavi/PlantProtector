 * @brief SPI Slave Code for Arduino
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of an SPI slave for Arduino. The code
 * handles the reception of data chunks over SPI, verifies their integrity using
 * CRC-16-CCITT, decodes the data using Hamming code, and processes the received
 * data. The main components of the code include:
 *
 * - CRC computation function
 * - SPI interrupt service routine
 * - Chunk handling function
 * - Byte-to-bit conversion function
 *
 * The code is designed to work with a chunk size of 32 bytes, where the last two
 * bytes are used for CRC. The received data is stored in a global buffer and
 * processed once the final chunk is received.
 *
 * @note The code assumes that the received data is encoded using Hamming code
 * and that the total number of chunks is known.

 * @brief Handles the received chunk of data over SPI.
 *
 * This function performs the following steps:
 * 1. Decode the hamming code.
 * 2. Verifies the CRC of the received chunk.
 * 2. Converts the encoded data to bits.
 * 3. Decodes each 7-bit segment using Hamming code.
 * 4. Converts the decoded bits back to bytes.
 * 5. Stores the decoded data in a buffer.
 * 6. Sends an ACK or NACK response over SPI.
 * 7. Processes the final chunk if it is the last one.
 *
 * The function expects the received chunk to be in the global variable `receivedChunk`.
 * The decoded data is stored in the global buffer `decodedBuffer`.
 * The function uses the global variables `expectedSeq`, `decodedPos`, and `total_chunks`
 * to manage the sequence and position of the data.
 *
 * @note This function assumes that the received chunk is 32 bytes long, with the last
 * two bytes being the CRC.
